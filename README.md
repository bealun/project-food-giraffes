#Food Review website 🌮🥑

Food review site for Japanese cuisine in London using the Zomato API in a team of 8 🇯🇵💥🍣🌸

## The Problem 
Created a site using the Zomato API specificly to search for japanese cuisine in London and getting it to sort on price and ratings. Divided the group in to smaller teams and divided the assignment equally. Set up a developer branch with the content both team needed to use and then added three branches for each group to code in. A branch for price sorting, one for the ratings and also another for the styling part. Shifted team mates on a regular to exchange knowledge and avoid getting stuck.

Ended with less code than expected and two functions - on for each sorting choice.
Great team work with loads of discussion and constructive code feedback to make it work.
